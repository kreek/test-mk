# Documentation

!!! warning "Requirement"
    - Providers **must** document their API using the OpenAPI Specification version 3.0.x
    - OpenAPI docs **must** be valid YAML or JSON so they are machine-readable.

## OpenAPI Specification
OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is the predominant API documentation standard in the industry. 

All providers on Lighthouse must document their APIs using the OpenAPI Specification as a requirement of onboarding. Version 3.0.3 of the OpenAPI Specification can be found [here](https://swagger.io/specification/).

### Documentation for humans and computers

An OAS serves as documentation for human consumers to read when evaluating or using an API and as a machine-readable input for Lighthouse tooling that verifies consistency between the APIâ€™s specification and its behavior.
                                          
OAS docs must be valid in [Swagger Editor](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-editor/).

#### Lighthouse OAS Subjective Rules
OAS docs also undergo a subjective review for items we can't automate or that are open to interpretation. Below is a list of the subjective rules found within this guide:

???+ success "Security"

    - Endpoints that return PII or PHI **must** use OAuth.
    - Endpoints secured with OAuth **must** list the required scopes in the security section of each endpoint.

???+ success "Headers"

    - APIs **must not** use headers to communicate business logic or service logic (such as paging response info or PII query parameters).
    - HTTP headers **should** only be used for the purpose of handling cross-cutting concerns such as authorization.

???+ success "Resource Operations"

    - `GET` Endpoints must use the POST method when creating resources without a consumer-supplied ID.
    - `GET` operations should return a 201 with the created resource reflected in the response body.
    - `POST` **should not** be idempotent; meaning, if the request is sent again, a second resource should be created.
    - `PUT` **should** be idempotent, meaning that calling it several times should return the same result.
    - Operations **should** return the created resource inside a `data` object.
    - Operations **should** return any errors inside an `errors` object.
    - Providers **should** show that a custom operation was intentional by ending the path with a verb.

???+ success "Naming & Formatting"

    - Fields **should** use camelCase.
    - Acronyms **should** be camelCase rather than uppercase.
    - Providers **should** avoid abbreviations.
    - Booleans **should** be prefixed with an auxiliary verb (such as is, has, or can).

1. OpenAPI Spec 3.0.x is the required version. Version 3.1 can not be used yet as SwaggerUI does not support it at this time.
2. If you use JSON Schema to define your models, you can set the dialect globally through the `jsonSchemaDialect` property.
3. Â The `servers` section should reflect your API's future external public-facing location when hosted on Lighthouse. All endpoints should then be relative to those base URLs. You can copy the example definition starting on this line (#9) to use in your OAS doc; remember to replace `rx` with your namespace.
4. Using `$ref` properties (references) to link to response body schema definitions helps keep your endpoint definitions short.
5. Errors happen. We require that all APIs let consumers know the error schema your API will return should your API encounter an unexpected error.
6. Many VA APIs rely on one or more upstream services for their data. If your API could throw a `500` if an upstream service returns an error, consider returning a `502` error instead, so you and the consumer know a dependency rather than the API is causing the issue.
7. If your API could throw a `500` if an upstream service is down, consider returning a `503` error instead, so you and the consumer know a dependency rather than the API is causing the issue.
8. Â All endpoints **must** have a security property. In this example, the endpoint does not require authentication. However, the `security` tag is still included but it contains an empty object. This lets us know security was left out on purpose.
9. Â Often, multiple API operations have some common parameters or return the same response structure. To avoid code duplication, you can place the common definitions in the global `components` section and reference them using [`$ref`](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/using-ref/).
10. Â Responses, and specifically errors, are likely to be the same for all endpoints. Defining them within the `components/responses` can help keep down the size of your path definitions.
11. Â `$refs` can have `$refs`. Â Think of schemas like their database counterparts. Each model and its relations should be a distinct schema.
12. This endpoint returns a veteran's prescription history, which qualifies as Personal Health Information (PHI). All endpoints that return PII or PHI **must** use OAuth.
13. Â Enums should be considered constants. As in 'C' style languages, they should be UPPER_CASE with underscores for spaces.
14. Components don't have to be resources. Any data that appears in multiple locations, such as a list of states, can be a component.
15. Info tags **must** include a `title` and a `description`.
16. Path methods **must** contain a shorter `summary` and a longer `description` that explains the purpose and function of each operation.
17. Requests should use URL or body parameters rather than headers to pass along requisite data unique to that endpoint.
18. Protected endpoints **must** define `401` Unauthorized and `403` Forbidden responses.
19. The `prescription.read` scope is required for this endpoint so it is listed in the security section.
